* __1:__ What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?
* __2:__ What is a block? when might you use a block>
* __3:__ Use the comma operator ( 4.10, p 1.57) to rewrite the while loop from 1.4.1(p.11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain where this rewrite improves or diminished the readability of this code. 
* __4:__ Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect. 
	+ (a) while `(string::iterator iter != s.end()) {/*...*/}`
	+ (b) while `(bool status = find(word)) {/* ... *?} if (!status) {/* ... */}`

* __5:__ Using an if-else statement, write your own version of the program to generate the letter grade from a numeric grade.

* __7:__ Write a function that returns 0 when its is first called and then generates numbers in a sequence each time it is called. 

* __8:__ Write a header file names Chapter6.h that contains declarations for the functions you wrote for the exercises in 6.1 (p.205).

* __10:__ Using pointers, write a function to swap the values of two ints. Test the function by calling it and printing the swapped values.

* __11:__ Write and test your own version of reset.
void reset(int &i)
{
	i = 0;
}

17: Write a function to determine whether a string contains any capital letters. Write a function to change a string to all lowercase. 

18: Write declarations for each of the following functions . When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does

A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that are refs, to a class named matrix

A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes two params, one is an int, and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>
