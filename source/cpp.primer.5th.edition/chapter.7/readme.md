* __1:__ Write a version of the transaction-processin program from (p. 24) using the Sales_data class you defined for the exercises (p.72).

* __2:__ Add the combine and isbn members to the Sales_data class you wrote for the exercises ins 2.6.2 (p. 76)

* __3:__ Revise your transation-processing program to uses these members &7.1.1 (p(256))

* __4:__ Write a class named Person that represents the name and address of a person. Use a string to hold each of these elements. Subsequent exerciese will incrementally add features to this class. 

* __5:__ Provide operations in your Person class to return the name and address. 

* __10:__ Using pointers, write a function to swap the values of two ints. Test the function by calling it and printing the swapped values.

* __11:__ Write and test your own version of reset.
```c++
void reset(int &i)
{
	i = 0;
}
```

* __17:__ Write a function to determine whether a string contains any capital letters. Write a function to change a string to all lowercase. 

* __18:__ Write declarations for each of the following functions . When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does

	(a) A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that are refs, to a class named matrix
	(b) A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes two params, one is an int, and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>

* __21:__ Write a function that takes an int and a pointer to an int and returns the larger of the int value or the value to which the pointer points. what type should you use for the pointer?

* __22:__ Write a function to swap two int pointers.

* __23:__ Write your own versions of each print functions presented in this section. Call each of these functions to print i, and j defined as follows
```c++
	int i = 0, j[2] = {0,1}
```

* __25:__ Write a main function  that takes two arguments. Concatenate the supplied arguments and print the resulting string. 

* __26:__ Write a program that accepts the options presented in this section. Print the values of the arguments passed to main. 

* __33:__ Write a recursive function to print the contents of a vector

* __44:__ Rewrite the isShorter function from p.211 to be inline.

* __51:__ Write all four versions of f. Each function should print a distinguishing message.  Check your answers for the previous exercise.  

* __54:__ Write a declaration for a function that takes two int parameters and returns an int, and declare a vector whose elements have this function type.

* __55:__ Write four functions that add, subtract, and multiply and divide two int values. Store pointers to these functions in your vector from the previous exercise. 

* __56:__ Call each element in the vector and print their result.
