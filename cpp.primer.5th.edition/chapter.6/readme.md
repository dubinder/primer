* __3:__ Write and test your own version of `fact`.

* __4:__ Write a function that interacts with the user, asking for a number and generating the factorial of that number. Call this function from `main`.

* __5:__ Write a function to  return the absolute value of its argument;

* __7:__ Write a function that returns 0 when its is first called and then generates numbers in a sequence each time it is called. 

* __8:__ Write a header file names Chapter6.h that contains declarations for the functions you wrote for the exercises in 6.1 (p.205).

* __10:__ Using pointers, write a function to swap the values of two ints. Test the function by calling it and printing the swapped values.

* __11:__ Write and test your own version of reset.
```c++
void reset(int &i)
{
	i = 0;
}
```

* __17:__ Write a function to determine whether a string contains any capital letters. Write a function to change a string to all lowercase. 

* __18:__ Write declarations for each of the following functions . When you write these declarations, use the name of the function to indicate what the function does

	(a) A function named compare that returns a bool and has two parameters that are refs, to a class named matrix
	(b) A function named change_val that returns a vector<int> iterator and takes two params, one is an int, and the other is an iterator for a vector<int>

* __21:__ Write a function that takes an int and a pointer to an int and returns the larger of the int value or the value to which the pointer points. what type should you use for the pointer?

* __22:__ Write a function to swap two int pointers.

* __23:__ Write your own versions of each print functions presented in this section. Call each of these functions to print i, and j defined as follows
```c++
	int i = 0, j[2] = {0,1}
```

* __25:__ Write a main function  that takes two arguments. Concatenate the supplied arguments and print the resulting string. 

* __26:__ Write a program that accepts the options presented in this section. Print the values of the arguments passed to main.
